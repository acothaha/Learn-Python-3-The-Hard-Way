# Learn-Python-The-Hard-Way

These are all of the exercise files from book "Learn Python 3 The Hard Way (Fourth Edition)" by Zed A. Shaw that i have finished so far,
although i haven't finish all of the exercises in the book, i can say that i have a good understanding about the materials and concepts
which this book taught so far, it is due to the drills and instructions that provided both in the book and the website. I may always
will refer this amazing book to whomever wants to start learning to code especially Python from scratch, because this book provides
detail step-by-step instructions, many drills to make sure you understand the concept, and many other features, also one other thing that
makes this book great is the community around it, you almost will find your problems posted in the website, if not, you can post your own
problem yourself and surely, someone even Zed himself will try to solve your problems.

so far, i haven't find any major obstacle while learning from this book, but the closer i get to the end of the book, i find that the 
concepts and  materials is getting harder to get a grasp on. but rest assured, there are some videos that will explain the exercises.

overall, this is a perfect book for beginner python learner, the language is easy to understand even with a non-native english speaker
like me, and with finishing this book, you will have whatever its needed to advance to the next part of learning python, whether it's 
machine learning, web developing, app developing, deep learning, data science, web scraping, making game, and many other stuff.

Happy Learning!!
